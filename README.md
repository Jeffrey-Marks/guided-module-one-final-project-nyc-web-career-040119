##### Hints

* Try to get to the top of the Stats Page leaderboard!

* Crops don't grow overnight, be patient! It might take a few days before you start noticing growth!

* Everyone's crops grow during the night, even if they're not logged in. Be careful about logging out with a field full of crops, they might not be there when you get back...

* If you're not getting the price you want for your plants, try getting a better night of sleep before you try to sell.

* Be careful about running out of money!
